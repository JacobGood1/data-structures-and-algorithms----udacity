Task 0:
The first problem is O(1) constant time. The reading of the files is O(n) but my solution accesses the start and end
of the array, this means that the time will be constant no matter the input size.

Task 1 - 3:
Task 1 - 3 are linear or O(n)

Task 4:

This task is quadratic since it contains a loop within a loop. so for each n + 1 we have (n + 1)^2 or O(n^2)
