Task 0:
The first problem is O(1) constant time. The reading of the files is O(n) but my solution accesses the start and end
of the array, this means that the time will be constant no matter the input size.

Task 1 - 2:
Task 1 - 2 are linear or O(n)

task 3:
since task 3 uses the sort function, which will dominate the time of execuation, the
time complexity is O(n log n)

Task 4:

This is the quadratic code:
for c,_,_,_ in calls:
        if c not in not_telemarketers:
            telemarketers.add(c)

the word <in> also loops through a data structure in linear time, thus this is a loop within a loop

This task is quadratic since it contains a loop within a loop, therefore it is O(n^2)
